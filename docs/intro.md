# About AlphaToken

AlphaToken, founded by Geoff Jiang (former CEO of Ant Group's Digital Technology Business Group), is bridging traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Backed by Yunfeng Capital and Yunfeng Financial Group, the company's mission is to build an inclusive and liqudity platform by democratizing access to institutional-grade financial products by tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) and seamlessly connecting to global users.

By moving assets like gold, stocks, and money market funds onto the blockchain, AlphaToken makes them accessible 24/7 and provides inclusive finance to a global audience. This process enhances market efficiency and transparency, removing the traditional barriers of banking hours and qualified-investor status.
